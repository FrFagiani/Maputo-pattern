# Maputo urban pattern

The aim of this project is to provide a guide about how to build a Shape file that identify *urban pattern* in Maputo region.
At the same time I will use this guide as an opportunity to start working with Github.

## What is an urban pattern?
Urban morphology analyze urban tissue considering both human artifacts, as phisical form and shape of settlements (streets, buildings, blocks) and human activities as set of functions or uses.
The city could be divided into homogeneous morphological settlements that are based on different urban pattern families.

> *Essi si distinguono per la genesi, per il peso (in termini di popolazione insediata, suolo urbanizzato, densità infrastrutturale ecc.), per la collocazione nel territorio e le relazioni che intrattengono con l’intorno, per gli abitanti e il tipo di attività che ospitano o possono ospitare, dunque per i modi nei quali spazio, economia e società vi si incontrano o possono incontrarvisi.*
>(Patrizia Gabellini, 2010)

Maputo context is very peculiar and different from European context. For this city has been identified 10 different patterns, mainly based on this features:
- roads network
- buildings typology and density
- bairros division
Human activities and functions are very difficult to identify in Maputo, especially from satellite images. Also there are few informations about this features or they are not detailed enough. So, uses and functions have not been considered or they have been considered partially in urban pattern definition.

### City center
Urban design is based on an orthogonal grid, with wide and regular roads. The buildings have many levels above the ground especially along the street front. There is a clear urban tissue and an architectural and urban planning idea.
