## List

#### HRSL
High Resolution Settlement Layer

*Description:*

The High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL) provides estimates of human population distribution at a resolution of 1 arc-second (approximately 30m) for the year 2015. The population estimates are based on recent census data and high-resolution (0.5m) satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe. The population grids provide detailed delineation of settlements in both urban and rural areas. The data were developed using computer vision techniques to classify blocks of optical satellite data as settled (containing buildings) or not. Proportional allocation was used to distribute population data from subnational census data to the settlement extents. The data are distributed as GeoTIFF files. The Population GeoTIFF represents population estimates (in persons)
